# SAFEDRIVER-
SAFEDRIVER is a precision-engineered embedded system built on the PIC16F877A. It monitors alcohol levels, gas leaks, and driver hand presence in real time. With intelligent sensor fusion and low-latency alerts, it provides a robust, low-power safety layer to prevent impaired or unsafe driving conditions.
