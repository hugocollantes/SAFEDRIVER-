# SAFEDRIVER-
SAFEDRIVER is a precision-engineered embedded system built on the PIC16F877A. It monitors alcohol levels, gas leaks, and driver hand presence in real time. With intelligent sensor fusion and low-latency alerts, it provides a robust, low-power safety layer to prevent impaired or unsafe driving conditions.

This repository includes the following key components:
SafedriverENG.c – The core source file written in C, implementing the complete logic of the project.
SAFEDRIVERPROJECTENG.pdf – A comprehensive technical report detailing the design decisions, methodology, implementation steps, and performance analysis of the project.

The document also includes a dedicated section with a video demonstration of the system in operation,which can be seen in youtube with this link https://youtu.be/7H1O3eaTX_g  (THE EXPLANATION IS IN SPANISH as we study on a spanish university,all documents have been translated into english).

Both files are meant to complement each other: the source code provides a hands-on view of the system, while the memory document offers theoretical support and justification behind each engineering decision.

We recommend reading the memory document before diving into the code.
